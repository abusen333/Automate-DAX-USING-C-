This repository is a collection of C# codes that automate Power BI DAX development by generalizing codes that work in different projects. Power BI is a popular business intelligence tool that allows users to create interactive visualizations and reports. DAX is the formula language used in Power BI to create calculations and measures. The codes in this repository can help developers automate the process of writing and maintaining DAX calculations and measures by generalizing commonly used code patterns across multiple projects. By reducing the amount of manual work involved in DAX development, these codes can save time and improve efficiency for developers working with Power BI.
